This can cause a lag in updating the projects list in the dashboard with the most recent projects.\\n\\n2. **Permissions settings**: It is possible that there are permissions settings in place that prevent certain projects from being displayed in the dashboard for specific users or user roles. The user may need to have the correct permissions to view all projects.\\n\\n3. **Filter settings**: Check if there are any filter settings applied to the projects list in the dashboard that may be inadvertently excluding Langsmith projects. Make sure that the filters are correctly configured to display all projects.\\n\\n4. **Technical issues**: There could be technical issues such as server problems, connectivity issues, or software bugs that are preventing the Langsmith projects from appearing in the projects list. It may require troubleshooting by the technical support team.\\n\\n5. **Data retrieval errors**: There could be errors in retrieving or populating the Langsmith projects data in the dashboard due to issues with data integration or API connections. This would require investigating the data retrieval mechanisms to identify and resolve any errors.\\n\\nTo address this issue, I recommend reaching out to the Langsmith technical support team or system administrator to investigate the root cause of the problem and implement the necessary solutions to ensure that Langsmith projects are correctly reflected in the projects list in the Langsmith dashboard.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 317, 'prompt_tokens': 39, 'total_tokens': 356, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-BFc9HOST7SysNxSb4kwiZqdBpGreC', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-bf4adc6a-5545-4430-9c42-80363a8dc219-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 39, 'output_tokens': 317, 'total_tokens': 356, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"
